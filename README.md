**It stands for "Creating a word processor so George R R Martin can finally finish his books".**

Actually, this is not why I'm creating this, I just thought it would be funny.

Funnier than that is to think if I (we) can finish it before he done it so he can actually use it. Can we?

# States of the project:
## 06 - Jan - 2023 - It's a readme file.

### 14:32 (Brazil) - George R R Martin can write a line and save it on the same folder as output.txt.

- But he can't add a new line to the file so if he uses the program again it will erase his past work.
    - It's a bug then?
    - It's not a bug, it's a feature, he shouldn't stop writing!

### Can George R R Martin write a book on this now?
Yes. He can't go back and forth and he can't actually put new lines, but he could choose a "safe word" to break a line and replace that word later.
        
It's a nice touch for BDSM enthusiasts, I guess.

#### But I'll try to make things easier for George.
